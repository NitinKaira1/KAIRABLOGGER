    <h2>Top 5 Free AI Tools Every Student Should Use in 2025</h2>
    <small>Written by Nitin | Aug 29, 2025</small>

    <p>
      As a student, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to study smarter, finish assignments faster,
      and save time for things I actually enjoy. That‚Äôs where AI tools come in. Over the past
      year, I‚Äôve experimented with a bunch of them, and honestly, some have completely changed
      the way I learn and work. The best part? Most of them are totally free (at least the
      basic versions).
    </p>

    <p>
      In this blog, I‚Äôll share the <b>Top 5 Free AI Tools</b> that I believe every student
      should try in 2025. These aren‚Äôt just random tools ‚Äî I‚Äôve personally used them for
      assignments, coding projects, note-making, and even presentations.
    </p>

    <!-- Tool 1 -->
    <h3>1. ChatGPT (Free Plan)</h3>
    <img src="img/Chatgpt.jpg" alt="ChatGPT" class="tool-img">
    <p>
      ChatGPT is hands down the tool I use the most. Whether it‚Äôs explaining complex coding
      concepts, generating ideas for essays, or even helping me debug my Python scripts, it‚Äôs
      like having a tutor available 24/7. The free version is more than enough for daily tasks.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps with coding (debugging, explanations, examples).</li>
      <li>Explains topics in simple terms (like a friend, not a textbook).</li>
      <li>Can draft essays, notes, or outlines in seconds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>How I use it:</b> I paste tricky coding errors, ask it to explain in steps, and usually
    get my answer faster than Googling for 20 minutes.</p>

    <!-- Tool 2 -->
    <h3>2. Grammarly</h3>
    <img src="img/Grammerly.jpg" alt="Grammarly" class="tool-img">
    <p>
      Grammarly has been a lifesaver when it comes to writing emails, assignments, or even blog
      posts like this one. It catches grammar mistakes, spelling errors, and even suggests better
      phrasing.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixes grammar and spelling errors instantly.</li>
      <li>Suggests more natural wording.</li>
      <li>Works inside browsers and Google Docs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>How I use it:</b> Before submitting any assignment, I run it through Grammarly to make
    sure I don‚Äôt lose marks for silly mistakes.</p>

    <!-- Tool 3 -->
    <h3>3. Notion AI</h3>
    <img src="img/Notion AI.png" alt="Notion AI" class="tool-img">
    <p>
      If you‚Äôve ever used Notion for notes, imagine supercharging it with AI. Notion AI can
      summarize long notes, create to-do lists automatically, and even answer questions from
      your own notes. Perfect for exams.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Summarizes long study notes.</li>
      <li>Creates task lists automatically.</li>
      <li>Lets you search your notes with natural language.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>How I use it:</b> I dump all my class notes into Notion, then ask it to summarize key
    points before exams. Way faster than re-reading everything.</p>

    <!-- Tool 4 -->
    <h3>4. Canva</h3>
    <img src="img/Canva.jpg" alt="Canva" class="tool-img">
    <p>
      Canva is more than just a design tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a student‚Äôs best friend for making
      presentations, posters, and even resumes. With AI features like ‚ÄúMagic Design,‚Äù you can
      generate slide decks or posters instantly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create presentations faster with templates.</li>
      <li>Use AI-generated designs to save time.</li>
      <li>Make resumes, posters, and infographics easily.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>How I use it:</b> Whenever I have a seminar or group project presentation, I build
    my slides in Canva. It looks professional without much effort.</p>

    <!-- Tool 5 -->
    <h3>5. QuillBot</h3>
    <img src="img/Quillbot.png" alt="QuillBot" class="tool-img">
    <p>
      QuillBot is an AI-powered paraphrasing tool. If you‚Äôre stuck rephrasing something or
      want to avoid plagiarism, this tool helps a lot. It also has grammar checking and
      summarization features.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paraphrases text into simpler words.</li>
      <li>Summarizes long articles into key points.</li>
      <li>Includes a free grammar checker.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>How I use it:</b> When I‚Äôm writing essays, I paste paragraphs into QuillBot to see
    simpler versions. It helps me avoid repeating the same wording over and over.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h3>üí° Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      As a student, time is your most valuable asset. These free AI tools don‚Äôt just make
      studying easier, they make it faster and more efficient. You don‚Äôt need to pay for
      expensive subscriptions right away ‚Äî just start with the free versions, and upgrade later
      if you really need advanced features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, if I had to pick only two, I‚Äôd go with <b>ChatGPT</b> for learning and coding,
      and <b>Grammarly</b> for writing. But honestly, all five together cover almost every area
      of student life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try them out this semester and see how much smoother your study routine becomes!
